    git commit -am "Final changes before release"
    git push
    
2. Tag this release and push tags:
    git tag -a v5.01 -m "Version 5.01 as released"
    git push --tags  
    

FIND INSTALLER MD5 SUM

   ssh username@gammon.com.au
   cd www/files/mushclient
   md5sum *501*     (version number here)
   

DO ANNOUNCEMENT

1. Update the "version" table on the database (record ID 0) to have the release information.
   Use "*" for bullet points in the description.
 
2. Load the plugin Make_Announcement.xml from the source/install directory

3. Type "make_announcement" to generate the announcement from the template with the hash etc. included

4. Paste the resulting announcement into a new forum message announcing the new release

5. Find the post number of that new message and amend forum database table bbsection, record 1 (MUSHclient section) to show the latest release and forum post to read about it.



UPDATE RELEASE NOTES

1. Change record for relnotes for this release to have today's date as release date
    

POST RELEASE NOTES TO GITHUB

    https://github.com/nickgammon/mushclient/tags

    Note, for each note item the explanatory lines should be indented four spaces (tab twice) so that the bulleted points are numbered correctly. Put "```" symbols around any code examples.
